1d)I modified the reward function by adding a 3 parameters to incentivise suction if there is a bug, desentivize not activating suction
when there is a bug, and different rewards on cpature of a bug for using lower settings to preserve resources. We only used settings 2 and 4 to make things simpler to impliment
I added the 1 and 3 functionality just in case we change it in the future. Also the inscentives are all slightly different to make the tie algorithm easier to impliment in the future. 

2a)To break the ties I made a function that stored the previous state and current state, checked it for utility/insentive it then proked the continue to keep the process so long as the 
world status hasnt updated. I also had a function for randomly continuing  based on the raandom double library element in java
